#   Overview
User authentication is a crucial feature of most web applications. In the next two chapters, we will be showing you two ways to authenticate users: traditional authentication and Spring Security.

Most web applications use a hashing mechanism such as BCrypt and session management to authenticate users. This is how web frameworks like Django and Ruby on Rails authenticate users, and that's what we refer to as "traditional authentication." On the other hand, Spring Security is the de-facto standard for securing Spring-based applications. It brings many benefits such as support for various authentication techniques, support for authentication and authorization, cross-site request forgery prevention, and much more. Wait a second, it really sounds that Spring Security is the way to go, so why are we teaching both?

Although the benefits of Spring Security are great, there are definitely some drawbacks. Spring Security is overly complex, configuration heavy, and the learning curve is steep. We want to teach you the traditional authentication first and have Spring Security as an option for you to dive in deeper into the Spring ecosystem. If you want to be a Spring developer, you must learn Spring Security.

The belt exams will not require you to use Spring Security.
