#   The Importance of Projects


We believe that projects are important for two main reasons: solidifying concepts that you have learned and creating strong portfolio pieces. We want to emphasize that projects are not assignments. They should be more comprehensive and complex than any of the assignments that you've done. Also, make sure that you get your belt __first__ before tackling a project. With that said, here are some technologies and concepts that you can add for your Java project:

*   AJAX
*   External API (google maps, yelp, etc)
*   OAuth (facebook, gmail login)
*   Responsive Web Design (Bootstrap, Foundation, Materialize)

Obviously, these are just some suggestions. Once you pass your belt exam, talk to your instructor with your project wireframe and get their approval. We will work with you so that your projects are impressive with enough complexity to be strong portfolio pieces.

Here is our project guideline: [Project Guideline](https://s3.amazonaws.com/General_V88/boomyeah2015/codingdojo/curriculum/content/chapter/CodingDojo_Project_Guideline.pdf)
