#   Auth
All web applications need a certain level of security. For example, logging into a website is a layer of security. By requiring users to log in, we are securing our web application against people that have not yet registered. Essentially, there are two basics forms of security: Authentication and Authorization.

##  __Authentication__
Authentication is the process of determining who the current user is. When you log in to Coding Dojo's learning platform, we are making sure that your credentials are correct and show you the appropriate information to your specific account.

##  __Authorization__
Authorization is the process of determining what resources a specific user can access. For example, in our learning platform, a student account may only have a few stacks available, but an instructor account can have all the stacks unlocked. Furthermore, a curriculum account can have all the stacks unlocked and the ability to edit content. There can be many levels of resource accessibility. In our example, our student account could only READ a few stacks, our instructor account could READ all stacks, and our curriculum account could READ and WRITE to all stacks.

In this chapter, we are going to learn how to implement Authentication and Authorization with Spring Boot.
