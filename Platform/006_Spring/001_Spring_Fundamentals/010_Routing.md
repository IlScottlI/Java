#   Getting Familiar with Routing
For this assignment, you are going to practice routes in Spring Boot. The goal is to master writing method level `@RequestMapping` annotations and `@RequestMapping` class level annotation

##  __Objectives:__
*   Practice creating a Spring Boot application.
*   Practice @RestController annotation
*   Master @RequestMapping.
### __Tasks:__
*   Create a controller named 'CodingController'. For the first 3 routes, use the `@RequestMapping` annotation.
*   Have an http GET request to 'http://localhost:8080/coding' display a text that says 'Hello Coding Dojo!'.
*   Have an http GET request to 'http://localhost:8080/coding/python' display a text that says 'Python/Django was awesome!'.
*   Have an http GET request to 'http://localhost:8080/coding/java' display a text that says 'Java/Spring is better!'.
*   Create another controller named 'DojoController'. For the routes below, use the `@PathVariable` annotation.
*   Have an http GET request to 'http://localhost:8080/dojo' display a text that says 'The dojo is awesome!'.
*   Have an http GET request to 'http://localhost:8080/burbank-dojo/' display a text that says 'Burbank Dojo is located in Southern California'.
*   Have an http GET request to 'http://localhost:8080/san-jose/' display a text that says 'SJ dojo is the headquarters'.
