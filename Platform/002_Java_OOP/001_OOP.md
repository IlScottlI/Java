# OOP
## __Objectives:__
*   Introduction to OOP
*   Implementing OOP in java

__OOP (Object Oriented Programming)__ is something that has revolutionized the way programming is done today. It was invented to help programmers better model complex real-world situations, but was quickly found to be useful in all sorts of situations. OOP is baked into the way Java works. Gaining a strong foundation in OOP will help you to avoid repeating code and make your programs safer and more understandable.

## __Overview__

This chapter is designed to teach object-oriented programming principles to help you better understand how to organize your code in the future.

*   Understand what objects and classes are and why they are useful
*   Understand how to create classes and objects in Java
*   Understand more advanced OOP concepts (inheritance, private vs. public, methods, etc.)
*   Understand the difference between procedural and OOP code

Here is an overview of the topics that will be covered in this chapter:

1.  __Objects and Classes__
2.  __Class Structure__
3.  __Instantiation__
4.  __Properties__
5.  __Methods__
6.  __Construct__

### __Code Sample:__
In this chapter we will also be using the `HelloWorld` class below to explore OOP concepts.
```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public String greet(String name){
        return "Hello " + name;
    }
    public String greet(){
        return "Hello World";
    }
}
```
```java
public class HelloWorldTest {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        HelloWorld hW = new HelloWorld();
        String greeting = hW.greet();
        String greetingWithName = hW.greet("Eduardo");
        if (greeting.equals("Hello World") || greetingWithName.equals("Hello Eduardo")){
            System.out.println("Test successful");
        } else{
            System.out.println("Test Fail");
        }
    }
}
```
