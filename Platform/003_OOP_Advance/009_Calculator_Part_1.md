#   Calculator Part I
A client of yours requires a basic calculator for their application. They need a way to run a series of operations and save the result. They only need adding and subtracting functionality right now. They need the method `performOperation` and `getResults` to be the methods that run all the operations and return the end result respectively.

● `setOperandOne(10.5)`

● `setOperation("+")`

● `setOperandTwo(5.2)`

● `performOperation()`

● `getResults()`

where the result would be `15.7`.

### __Objectives:__
● Practice classes and objects.

● Implement a calculator in java.

### __Tasks:__
● Create the `Calculator` bean that will allow for the user to set operands and operations, then perform them and get the results.

● Have logic for adding and subtracting.
